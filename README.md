# Carbon-Footprint-Tracker
 
1. Install and import the neccessary Packages.cor
2. Load the Dataset (Real time dataset).
3. Data Preprocessing.
4. Feature Engineering & Scaling (Normalization).
5. Model training using models LSTM (For Sequential data) and time series Forecasting, ANN (For Non sequential data such as graphs and images), Genetic Algorithm using Pygad to Optimize carbon emissions reduction strategies, XGBoost tree Classifier, its a gradient used to boost the model.
6. Define Fitness function, is used to determine how a good solution is, goal is to minimize emissions lower emissions means higher fitness score.
7. Hybrid model evaluation using Mean squared error (mse).
8. Loading the pretrained model and scalar.
9. Providing the Streamlit User Interface for user inputs.
10. Predicting the Carbon Footprint according the user inputs.
11. SHAP (Shapely Additive Explanations) Analysis for Explanability, which shows which feature is contributing more towards the carbon emissions.
12. Emission Reduction Strategies according the Carbon Footprint.
13. Providing the Gemini AI Chatbot for Sustainability Tips
